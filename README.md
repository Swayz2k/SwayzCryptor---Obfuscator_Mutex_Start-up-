1. DESCRIPTION

====================================================================

SwayzCryptor is a encrypter (or 'cypher') that allows users to encrypt the source code of their program.

This tool works by encrypting the source code of an executalbe, making it difficult for security software to detect the original code. SwayzCryptor assigns hidden values to each part of the code, thus effectively masking it from standard security scans.

The tool is designed to obfuscate software in a way that standard antivirus programs cannot easily identify. It's part of a broader category of software known as "crypters," which are widely used to enhance the stealth of payloads​.

2. HOW TO USE

====================================================================

0. Disable antivirus if needed [Mostly it's not needed].
1. Install or Directly Run the Program.
2. If necessary, use given crack or serial to register this software.
3. Done, enjoy, share, like, and support us.

3. ABOUT ANTIVIRUS AND COMPRESSED BINARIES

====================================================================

This release's binary is packed with an executable/dll compression tool to
reduce his size (for an easy and quick upload/download).

Unfortunatly, some of these compression programs have a bad reputation in the
security software industry, mainly because almost 99% of troyans/worms/etc.
is packed with similar tools (or variants of these), and this self-unpack
behavior is taken by some antivirus apps as an alarm signal.

Basically, this means that any trusted program packed with one of these tools
can be erroneously detected as a virus, something know as a "FALSE POSITIVE".

********************************************************************************
IMPORTANT: If you got this release from us, from the site indicated above or from
our official torrent websites accounts so just ignore any warning from your antivirus
software (most certainly it's a false positive).

IF YOU GOT THIS FROM ELSEWHERE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT YOUR COPY WILL BE FREE
OF ANY THREAT; IN THAT CASE, I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGED CAUSED
TO YOUR COMPUTER. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
